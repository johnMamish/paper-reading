In a multi-procesor system, 'directories' are structures that keep cache coherency. To keep cache coherency, directories must be visible to other processors. Even though work has been done to hide the first-level cache from other cores so that malicious software running on one core can't observe memory access patterns in a victim core, cache directories still leak this information. The authors introduce secdir, which is a scalable cache directory which doesn't perform much worse than 'traditional' cache directories and is immune to this type of attack. I don't fully understand it, but it's based on changing the cache behavior when a conflict is generated in the directory (section 4.2).
