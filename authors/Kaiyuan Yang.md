## KaiYuan Yang
KaiYuan Yang  specializes in low-power analog circuits, especially their applications in computer security. He is working with us on the DARPA project and specializes in low-power analog circuits. He could be a good collaborator for future work on energy harvesting front-ends.

Because he is a professor at Rice university where [[Richard Baraniuk|Richard Baraniuk]] and [[Kevin Kelly|Kevin Kelly]] (the authors of the famous [[Single-pixel imaging via compressive sampling|one-pixel camera]]) are faculty, he's very knowledgeable about compressive sensing.
