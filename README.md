## Organization
This Obisdian vault contains summaries of papers that I've read. The bulk of the vault is paper summaries organized by topic, then conference, then year. Paper summaries should all follow [[template|this template]].

## Tags
In order to help me draw connections between papers, I also tag papers with backlinks to placeholder pages. Papers can be tagged with author names, topics, or notable paper attributes (e.g. awards, importance). "Placeholder" pages reside in the root-level authors, keywords, and tags folders.

Because of Obsidian's backlinking and organization features, I can tag things. Some ideas of tags:
 - About paper "quality"
	 - "Best of"
	 - "important/foundational in its field"
	 - "best paper award"
	 - "test of time award"
	 - "well-written"
	 - "good figures"
 - About paper topic, e.g.
	 - "intermittent computing"
	 - "energy harvesting"
	 - "circuit design"
	 - "security"
	 - "prefetching"
 - Tag with author's name
 
This means that I'd be able to look at all of the "foundational" papers about "intermittent computing" with an SQL query.
