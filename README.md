## Organization
This Obisdian vault contains summaries of papers that I've read. The bulk of the vault is paper summaries organized by topic, then conference, then year. Paper summaries should all follow the file marked "template" in the root directory.

Obsidian lets you embed LaTeX equations!
$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} $$

## Tags
In order to help me draw connections between papers, I also tag papers with backlinks to placeholder pages. Papers can be tagged with author names, topics, or notable paper attributes (e.g. awards, importance). "Placeholder" pages reside in the root-level authors, keywords, and tags folders.

Obsidian hashtag-based tags should NOT be used for this. Obsidian tags are second-class citizens in the graph view and restrict usability quite a bit.
 - About paper popularity / quality
	 - I like it a lot: tags/favorite
	 - It has a ton of citations: tags/highly-cited
	 - important/foundational in its field: tags/foundational
	 - best paper award: tags/best-paper-award
	 - test of time award: tags/test-of-time-award
	 - well written: tags/writing-example
	 - good figures: tags/figure-example
 - About paper topic, e.g.
	 - keywords/analog
	 - keywords/security
	 - keywords/batteryless
	 - keywords/energy-harvesting
 - Tag with author's name
On an author's page, I can include some information about personal interactions we've had. For instance, from talking with Kaiyuan Yang, I know that he has connections to compressive sensing research because he works at Rice.
 - Tag with the name of a lit review I'm trying to do
 
This means that I'd be able to look at all of the "foundational" papers about "intermittent computing" with an SQL query.

## To-Do
There are a couple things I'd like to do to make the Obsidian experience nicer to work with:
 - [ ] Move notes from [[Energy Adaptive Compression]] to their own documents; make lit-review tag for Energy adaptive compression
 - [x] Figure out how to color-code nodes based on folder (I want all the "author" nodes to be, say, red)
