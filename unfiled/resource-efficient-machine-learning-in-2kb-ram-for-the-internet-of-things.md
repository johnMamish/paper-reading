As of the mid-2010s, the vision for the internet of things was a bunch of sensors with just enough compute to read them and offload the data to the cloud where it would be analyzed. Unfortunately, the "offloading to the cloud" part of this proposal has proved to be an issue; internet connectivity isn't always guaranteed, communications are power intensive, and latency can make interesting applications infeasible. An alternative is for sensor data to be processed on the edge, right where the sensor is, which would overcome the above listed barriers at the cost of using less sophisticated models. Whereas a server can use a thousands of Joules to evaluate a DNN that takes up hundreds of megabytes, an edge system can only take a few mW and a few kBytes.

The authors introduce Bonsai, a sparse tree classifier which only needs a few kB of RAM to be evaluated.
