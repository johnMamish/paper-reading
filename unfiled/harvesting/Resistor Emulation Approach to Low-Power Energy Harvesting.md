#### Summary
To efficienty harvest energy, switching regulators are needed, however, controlling switching regulators takes power; for very low-power harvesting sources, the energy generated can be overwhelmed by the power consumption of the control circuitry itself. The authors use the observation that - for many low-power harvesting sources - power is optimally harvested by presenting a constant resistance.
The authors introduce a simple method for emulating a constant resistance using a switching regulator. The control circuitry for this regulator is very low-overhead. They demonstrate several circuit topologies and characterize the source of power loss in the harvester for each topology. They also descrie some example power sources that their circuitry can be used with.

#### Strengths
  - Excellent characterization of inefficiency (figure 5)
  - Good experimental coverage
  - Exciting results

#### Weaknesses
  - Understanding of role of input capacitor seems limited
  - No description of how LF oscillator is implemented
  - Limited discussion on origina of inaccuracy in resistor emulation

#### What potential directions of future work remain (if any)?
