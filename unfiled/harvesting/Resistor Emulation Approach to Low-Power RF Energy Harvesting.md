#### Summary
To harvest maximum energy from rectennas (rectified antennas), a switching regulator must operate at the maximum power point. However, the control circuitry to achieve this often consumes more power than is harvested. This work presents a highly efficient boost regulator control circuit which appears to the input as a roughly constant value resistor and to the output as a bursty current source.
The authors use a key insight: if the regulator stays in DCM mode and has good input filtering, they just need to operate the inductor at a fixed duty cycle to achieve a fixed resistor emulation.
