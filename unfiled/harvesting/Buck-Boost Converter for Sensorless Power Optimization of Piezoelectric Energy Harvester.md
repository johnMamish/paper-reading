#### Summary
When harvesting power from very small energy sources, both net harvested power and harvester efficiency are critical. For a wide class of energy sources, maximal power can be harvested by a fixed resistor; this insight is used to design and test a highly efficient harvester circuit. The authors develop theory for maximal power harvesting from a piezoelectric source, discuss harvester circuit design, and present a buck-boost controller which successfully harvests energy from a piezoelectric source driven between 50 and 85Hz.

#### Additional comments
Useful insight into "resistor emulation" in equation (12): achieving resistor emulation will require feedback if the circuit exits DCM.

#### What potential directions of future work remain (if any)?

Some comments about the citations
- [[Adaptive Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Circuit for Wireless Remote Power Supply]]
  This cited work is foundational for power harvesting circuits. The discussed work draws heavily from this work.
- [[Optimized Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Circuit Using Step-Down Converter in Discontinuous Conduction Mode]]
  The discussed work claims that this is the source of the idea of resistor emulation with buck converters ("This principle was first proposed by Ottman et al")
- [[Energy reclamation from a vibrating piezoceramic composite beam]]
  The discussed work claims that this is the source of the idea of resistor emulation with flyback converters, however I can't find this paper with a cursory search of the internet
