#### Summary
In order for their potential as alternative energy sources to be realized, an accurate AC model of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells must be ascertained. To do this, the authors perform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on a commercially available Nexa 1200 fuel cell (capable of producing 1,200 Watts). Using a frequency response analyzer and a programmable DC electronic load, they bias the cell at a number of different currents (1-5, 7, 10, 25, 35, and 40 Amps) and apply a superimposed AC current with magnitude 10% of the DC component swept from 0.05Hz to 20kHz and measure the impedance response. These experiments generate a number of Nyquist plots (Fig 5 and 6) and the authors also create an equivalent circuit model (Fig. 3 and 4).

In section 4, the authors identify 3 effects that contribute to the behavior observed in the Nyquist plots: Ohmic losses, Anode & Cathode activation losses and mass transfer losses. They analyse the origin of each of these effects.

This paper lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of a very exciting alternative energy source. Our research group is interested in MFCs - a related technology - and this work as been used as a starting point for similar work on MFCs.

#### Strengths
  - Thorough explanation of experimental setup
  - Nicely explained plots
  - Nice development of equivalent circuits

#### Weaknesses
  - Authors try to blame experimental setup parasitics for some behaviour that they see at 20kHz. IMO this is far too low to start blaming these things.
  - Discussion of how the commerical PEM's control affects experimentation is limited.
