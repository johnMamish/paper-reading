In countries with large, dense populations and inconsistent driver testing, the accessibility of examinations to grant driving licenses is a major public safety issue. The authors in the paper present a windshield-mounted system based on a commodity smartphone platform which performs driver exams to determine a driver's competency.

The authors focus mainly on driver gaze tracking using only the user-facing camera and vehicle SLAM using only the forward-facing camera. Gaze tracking is achieved by employing a standard facial landmark detection system and a novel eye-ROI extraction technique. SLAM is achieved using standard techniques augmented by fiducials on roadsigns whose position is not known before hand. A main assertion of the paper is that driver gaze is a predicitor of driving safety.

This is a well-done systems paper that does something compelling using a widely-available platform, but I question whether there is anything novel here.

Hot takes:
personal interest: 4/10
paper quality / novelty: 5/10 (only due to lack of novelty. other than that, it's a great paper).
