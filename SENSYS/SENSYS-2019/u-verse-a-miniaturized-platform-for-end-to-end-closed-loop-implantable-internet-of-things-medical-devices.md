Although there's been a lot of work in energy harvesting, low-power operation, and low-power communication for implantable medical devices, the authors claim that there has been no full system bringing all these things together so that they can be demonstrated working in conjunction. The authors introduce a compact system (basically a system design exercise) which harvests energy and communicates via MHz acoustic waves in the human body. They include a reasonable amount of discussion about system design, a characterization of their ultrasonic transducer, and an end-to-end applications demo discussing power required to measure, recieve, and transmit data as well as a discussion of harvested energy.

Hot takes:
personal interest: 6/10
paper quality / novelty: 5/10
A not-very-well-carried-out design exercise in a VERY cool and important design space. If the point of this paper is the system, they could have done a lot better in a few places (system size & connector solutions for instance).

There are also some design choices that they elaborate on which really don't need clarification, which makes this feel like a report done for the final project in an undergrad level class.
