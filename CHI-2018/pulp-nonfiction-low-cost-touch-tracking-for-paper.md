The authors present a method for constructing paper which can act as a touch screen via electrical field tomography. Their method is extremely scalable and will not significantly increase the cost of paper; all they do is coat the paper with a conductive layer. Once it has been coated with the conductive layer, electrode readings are taken from 16 points on the perimeter of the paper, from which tomography can be performed and writing implements or fingers can be sensed. To overcome issues due to sheet-to-sheet variation and user-to-user variation, the authors feed the output of the tomography into a neural network.

They conduct a user study resulting in ~1000 traced shapes over different users.

Hot takes:
personal interest: 6/10
This is a very cool CHI concept

paper quality / novelty: 6/10
Cool idea, but there are a number of issues that I either missed in my initial reading or weren't addressed by the authors. My 2 biggest ones: won't resting one's hand on the paper affect readings significantly? Also, doesn't the inclusion of the electrodes cut out, like, a full inch of the paper's border? They don't adequately explain how the electrode connection works AFAICT.
