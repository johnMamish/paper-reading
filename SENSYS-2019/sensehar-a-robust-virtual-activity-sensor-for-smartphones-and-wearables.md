Commodity body-worn sensor suites are highly heterogeneous. They vary between users; on a single user, they may vary during the time of day as someone adds and removes devices; "transfer functions" are different between sensors: some will be on feet, some will be in pockets, and some will be on wrists; and sample rates among the sensor suite will vary.

AFAICT, this paper is basically a "supersensor" framework for wearable applications. The authors introduce a low-dimensional latent space that is agnostic of sensor sample rate, modality, and precision. Whether the user has a single cheap smartphone in her left pocket or they are outfitted with 8 high-precision body worn sensors, the readings are projected into the same space.

Hot takes:
personal interest: 5/10
paper quality / novelty: 6.5/10 (maybe I'd be more convinced if I'd read more).
