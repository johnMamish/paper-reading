## Solar
- [[Power Controller Design for Maximum Power Tracking in Solar Installations]]
  Foundational, mostly focuses on a control law to choose buck regulator duty cycle u(t) to maximize input and output power.

## Coil-Based
* [[Electromagnetic Energy Harvester Interface Design for Wearable Applications]]
  *** This is the one you were really inspired by from the Tsinghua prof

## "Resistor Emulation"
- [[Resistor Emulation Approach to Low-Power RF Energy Harvesting]]
  Even though this paper is aimed at RF harvesting, in principle they are proposing the same thing that we want to do - have a DC/DC regulator behave like a resistor at its input port.
  They refer to this technique as **resistor emulation** and say that it has already found broad use in switching PFC circuits.

# Questions
- In [[Resistor Emulation Approach to Low-Power RF Energy Harvesting]], why do they turn on and off a square wave? why not just adjust the duty cycle of the pwm directly? Some thoughts on why this might be:
   1. Control circuitry to precisely adjust PWM would be too high power (I bet this is it.)
   2. Keeping a square wave improves resistor emulation (not sure about this one ?)
   3. Makes it easier to keep circuit in DCM (also not sure about this one)
