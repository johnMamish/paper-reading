## RF
- [[Resistor Emulation Approach to Low-Power RF Energy Harvesting]]
  Even though this paper is aimed at RF harvesting, in principle they are proposing the same thing that we want to do - have a DC/DC regulator behave like a resistor at its input port.
  They refer to this technique as **resistor emulation** and say that it has already found broad use in switching PFC circuits.
