One of the primary things that makes many mircoarchitectural side-channel attacks infeasible is how noisy the snooped information is. To get a result with high confidence from a noisy attack, the victim program has to be run hundreds of times. The authors present Microscope, a microarchitectural replay attack where an adversarial operating system can glean information from normally noisy microarchitectural side-channels by forcing a victim program to replay certain sections over and over, even if the program is executed only once.

The basic idea is to trigger a page fault just before the instruction whose side channel information you want to snoop. The victim program could execute tens or even hundreds of instructions speculatively before the results are squashed and the program goes back to the page fault. These speculatively executed instructions still leak information from architectural side channels (like in a port contention attack where the malicious program tries to execute different types of instructions on the same core as the victim program (section 4.3)). The leaked info may be very noisy, but because it's executed speculatively, the malicious program can trigger it as many times as it wants.

SPECULATIVE EXECUTION STRIKES AGAIN!!!
