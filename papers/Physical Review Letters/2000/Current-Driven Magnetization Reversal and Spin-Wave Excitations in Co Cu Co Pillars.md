#### Summary
In 2000, when this paper was written, MTJ pillars showed promise as nonvolatile memory storage devices, however, more efficient methods for changing their magnetization was needed. The authors demonstrate that the magnetization of a thin layer of an MTJ can be switched by driving a spin-polarized current through it; the spin-polarized current exerts a torque on the magnetic moment of the thin layer. The authors fabricate Co/Cu/Co MTJs with diameter 130nm +/- 30nm; one of the Co layers is thicker than the other to prevent its magnetization from changing. Because the MTJ has one Co layer that is resistant to remagnetization, changes in moment of the thinner layer can be detected due to GMR. The authors apply a fixed field to the MTJs and sweep an applied spin-polarized current, showing that the measured resistance of the device changes; this indicates flipping of the thinner Co layer. They compare their experimental results to theory which incorporates spin transfer effects into the LLG equation, showing that the model predicts the hysteretic effect observed. This paper would go on to lead the way for **spin transfer torque** MTJs..

Full switching doesn't occur if the applied external field is too strong. Instead, the authors observe spin-waves.
