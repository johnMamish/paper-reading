## Magnetorheological Fluid-Based Flow Control for Soft Robots
#### Kevin McDonald, Abigail Rendos, Stephanie Woodman, Keith A. Brown, and Tommaso Ranzani, 2020
#### Summary
Soft robots are promising for a number of applications - they're cheap to manufacture and more compliant than their rigid counterparts. Unfortunately, soft robots have limited Degrees of Freedom (DsoF) - each DoF that is added requires an additional bulky fluidic channel. The researchers present a novel method whereby DsoF are added to a soft robot without adding more fluidic channels; instead, magnets control the flow of a magnetorheological (MR) fluid (a fluid that's sensitive to magnetic fields).

The authors concoct an MR fluid (see experimental section for recipe - it's simple!) whose yield stress is modulated by an external magnetic field. They intoduce the design for an MR fluid valve (figure 1); the valve consists of an inlet, an outlet, and a branch whose pressure is modulated. Even when multiple MR fluid valves are in the same fluid circuit, the valves can be separately actuated by their own individual magnetic fields. This means that extra DsoF can be added without complicating the fluidic circuitry. The authors also present and experimentally characterize a model of the MR fluid they've concocted.

They make a simple soft robot with 5 DoF and manually actuate each different DoF with a magnetic jig, showing the response of the system (Figure 3).

This work promises to make soft robots way more capable without sacrificing their positive qualities. I'm interested in seeing actual systems implemented and characterized with this technique.

#### Strengths
  - Novel technique
  - Easy to replicate
  - Number of interesting future directions

#### Weaknesses
  - Wish they would've had other valve configurations
  - Didn't like how the paper didn't have sections, but it's possible that this was a constraint of the journal.

#### Additional comments
The magnetorheological fluid (MR fluid) is very easy to make at home! This would be an easy study to replicate.

Very interested in the power consumption of a system that uses 

What about a solid state MR pump? I'd be interested in finding work like that... Possible that it wouldn't work.

#### What potential directions of future work remain (if any)?
Would be very interesting to see this work in a low-power context with an **electropermanent magnet**.
