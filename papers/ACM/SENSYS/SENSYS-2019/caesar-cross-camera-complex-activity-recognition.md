As the number of cameras usable for surveillance grows, the manpower needed to monitor them will increase intractably. Monitoring complex sequences of actions between cameras requires distribution of computation over many individual nodes, each of which may not have enough compute power to do the requisite computation. The authors introduce a grammar for specifying "complex activities", sequences of "atomic activities" identified by DNNs ("talking on a phone", "getting into a car", "standing") which can be strung together over multiple cameras. This grammar enables the system to lasily evalute DNNs, which makes it tractable to offload data to an edge cluster for low-latency computation.

Hot takes:
personal interest: 10/10
I have a deep personal interest in this paper. The clear, unabashed goal of this work is to work towards mass surveillance. To my eye, it seems like the authors are trying to whitewash this goal. I find this work morally reprehensible in the highest degree. This sort of work enables fascist regimes.

paper quality / novelty: 5/10
I'm not sold on their approach. They're trying to make a distributed learning problem tractable by beating a long-dead horse from the first golden age of AI back to life.
