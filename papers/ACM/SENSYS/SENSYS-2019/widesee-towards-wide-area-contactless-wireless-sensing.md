Human detection can be estimated by looking at how RF signals reflect from a building (duh, this is radar). For existing systems to overcome interference and multipath effects, they've traditionally had to rely on heavy directional antennas that take a long time to change their radiation pattern via mechanical actuation. The authors implement an antenna that can use RF switches to agile-ily alter it's radiation pattern. They also introduce a bunch of math that I didn't have time to digest which estimates human position by looking at the reflected power spectrum of the radio.

Hot takes:
personal interest: 5/10
Cool RF stuff that I'd like to understand better, but which isn't directly relevant to my research. Very creepy potential surveillance applications.

paper quality / novelty: 8(??)/10
IDK how to analyze RF black magic, but this all seemed like sane compositions of cutting-edge techniques with some novel antenna and math ideas thrown in.
