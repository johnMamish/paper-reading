## SolderlessPCB: Reusing Electronic Components in PCB   Prototyping through Detachable 3D Printed Housings
#### Z Yan, J Li, Z Zhang, H Peng, 2024
#### Summary
Prototype PCBs often result in e-waste: components used for one iteration of a prototype and bonded to a PCB that's never ultimately used. The soldered components are typically discarded with the unused PCB, generating e-waste. The authors present a method for mechanically bonding surface-mount components to PCBs which doesn't generate e-waste. After a prototype is no longer useful, it's simply disassembled and components can be used in future prototypes.

The authors achieve this by designing a variety of 3d-printable retaining mechanisms for individual components. Once a conventional PCB has been designed, it can be made into a SolderlessPCB by taking these 3d-printable retainer mechanisms and combining them together into a single block which fits snugly against the target PCB, held in place by small bolts.
