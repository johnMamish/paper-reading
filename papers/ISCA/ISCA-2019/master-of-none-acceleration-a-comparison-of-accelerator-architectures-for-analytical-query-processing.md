The authors challenge the widely-held assumption that heterogeneous accelerators will outperform homogenous accelerators for highly specialized workloads. As a case study to investigate this assumption, they look at a heterogeneous accelerator that they previously designed to do analytical query processing. They design a new accelerator that's homogenous and compare the performance of the 2 accelerators at different workloads. Because of the improved flexibility of the homogenous accelerator, they find that the homogenous accelerator has higher per-core usage and that it outperforms the heterogeneous accelerator for small workloads.

They discuss why this may be in section 7. I didn't follow much in sections 2 - 6... I'm not familiar with their previous accelerator work (the Q100 accelerator).

Hot takes:
personal interest: 2/10
paper quality / novelty: 5/10  (conclusion seems obvious, but I guess someone had to do it).
