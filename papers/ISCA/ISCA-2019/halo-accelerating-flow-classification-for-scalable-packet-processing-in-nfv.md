This paper proposes the addition of some computing hardware inside a coherencey circuit in last-level caches to speed up a certain type of computation common in network workloads called "flow classification". Seems to be related to finding packets that should be grouped together? Involves calculating hashes? They don't explain it well.

Hot takes:
personal interest: 2/10
paper quality / novelty: 5??/10 (points off cause the explanation was clear as mud. Also, clear as mud explanation --> bad paper quality)
