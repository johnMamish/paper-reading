In "traditional" cpu architecture techniques, a cpu's clock cycle must be at least as long as the longest propagation time in the worst PVT corner of the system. This means that there is a lot of slack for instructions that take less time. The slack in these instructions waste energy; the CPU can be just sitting around for over half of a cycle when the properly computed values have already propagated to the next pipeline stage and are waiting. This extra slack is referred to as "Dynamic Timing Slack".

Some works already have ways to turn DTS into power savings by adjusting clock frequency on a per-instruction basis. This work uses compiler design to increase the amount of DTS so that a DTS-aware processor can save even more power due to the maximized DTS.
