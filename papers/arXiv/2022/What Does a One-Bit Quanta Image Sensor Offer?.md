## What Does a One-Bit Quanta Image Sensor Offer?
#### Stanley H. Chan, 2022
#### Summary
A new class of image sensors which sense single photons is emerging (quantum image sensors (QIS)); instead of measuring the amount of light incident on a pixel over a time period (as in conventional image sensors (CIS)), these sensors measure whether or not a single photon is incident on a pixel over a time period. Due to their dramatically lower noise and higher frame rate, these sensors offer a number of advantages over their multi-bit counterparts in spite of their bit depth; namely improved low-light performance, improved frame rate, and improved dynamic range for the same scene.

The paper uses a theoretically ideal mathetical model of a certain type of QIS to evaluate its performance. The ideal model accounts for scene brightness, Poission noise inherent in photography, and sensor read noise. The paper develops mathematical descriptions of QIS and CIS performance in low-light, high frame rate, and high dynamic range situations. The analysis is limited to CIS-QISes, but can be extended to SPAD-QISes by incorporating dark count noise and setting read noise to 0.
