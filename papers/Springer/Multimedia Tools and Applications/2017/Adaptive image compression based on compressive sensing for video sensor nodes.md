## Adaptive image compression based on compressive sensing for video sensor nodes
#### [[Xufan Zhang]], [[Yong Wang]], [[Dianhong Wang]], [[Yamin Li]], 2017
Note: this is a sequel to [[Energy-Efficient Image Compressive Transmission for Wireless Camera Networks]] by the same authors. The two papers are almost identical. This one was submitted about 1 year after the previous one.

#### Summary
This paper is substantially similar to "Energy-Efficient Image Compressive Transmission for Wireless Camera Networks" by the same authors. As far as I can tell, there are only a few differences:
 1. They add an elaborate way of re-arranging the Haar coefficients before applying the sensing matrix; this results in a shorter sampling matrix.
 2. Removal of discussion about ROI
 3. Additional experiments on different images

#### Strengths
 *

#### Weaknesses
 * Their method for rearranging the HWT coefficients is not explained clearly. An opaque explanation is made worse by very bad typesetting (Section 3.1).
