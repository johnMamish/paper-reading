Communication between WAN and PAN devices is highly desirable, but because of incompatible PHY layers, traditional approaches require a dedicated radio for each link, or a radio gateway; both of these approaches are undesirable because of practicality, affordability, and the need to buy new hardware. There has been some work in misusing WAN PHYs so that they send frames to PAN devices like zigbees, they do this by selecting a legal TX waveform for the WAN PHY whose frequency content is sufficiently similar to the desired PAN PHY signal; these frequency-based emulation approaches have an intractably high error rate.

The authors introduce a method for significantly improving RX rate (from ~50% to > 99%) of PAN signals sent by WAN PHYs. They do this by using time-domain analysis instead of frequency domain analysis. Because of turbo coding and CRC addition that's standard in the LTE stack, they also need to solve a computationally expensive inverse turbo code problem, which they do by pre-computing some matricies.

Cool, but idk how relevant it is to my research. Could we maybe have LTE packets crafted to deliver maximum energy to a harvester node??

paper quality / novelty: 8.5/10
The problem sounds like it would take some RF black magic shit to solve it, but they explain the 2 or 3 clever tricks that they employ in a really clear way. Amazing.
