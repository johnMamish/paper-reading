Rowhammering attacks allow a program to modify the memory of another program by activating and deactivating DRAM lines that are adjacent to the victim memory cell. An architectural mitigation to RH attacks is to include a counter on each DRAM row to determine when a row has been activated too many times and might start interfereing with adjacent rows; this is infeasible because it would take waaaaay too many counters. Because of DRAM interfaces, the number of successful rowhammer attacks that can be mounted simulaneously is stricty limited, so only a limited number of counters need to be kept around.

The authors present "twice", a counter mechanism that kinda feels like an associative cache. it only keeps track of cache lines that have been activated a TON, ignoring rarely used cache lines. This decreases the number of counters by many orders of magnitude and makes the problem tractable.

Moreover, because the memory controller doesn't have all of the information about physical mapping of the DRAM's rows, they introduce a "refresh adjacent row" insruction to DRAM interfaces. If the memory controller sees that a line is acting suspiciously, it may be trying to flip it's adjacent lines, and the mem controller can issue a "refresh adjacent row" command to thwart the attempt.

Hot takes:
personal interest: 6/10
paper quality / novelty: 8/10  (definately biased on this one; the idea is obvious. but I like it because it's sound and it's applied to a problem that I find interesting).
