"monolithic 3d" (m3d) is emerging as a potential method for integrating logic designs vertically. As opposed to previous attempts which used through-silicon-vias (TSVs) to connect seperately fabricated dies, M3D involves fabricating a die, growing a silicon layer on top of the finished die, and then fabricating another design on top of it. Whereas TSVs are prohibitively large, M3D designs have inter-level vias that are a workable size. However, the subsequent layers grown on top have lower performance; they need to be fabricated at lower temperatures to preserve the design on the bottommost layer.

The authors discuss a few ways that M3D can lead to system-level improvements (e.g. less propagation delay because designs take less space, using different technologies for different layers, having NoCs that don't need to stretch as far). They also talk about the challenges that come with the non-heterogenous performance of the two layers.
