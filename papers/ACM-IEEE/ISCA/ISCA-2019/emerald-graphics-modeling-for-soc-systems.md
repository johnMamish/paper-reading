The widely used gem5 SoC simulator doesn't have support for graphics. When assessing applications that typically rely on a GPU for graphics rendering, researchers using gem5 and similar simulators just use software rendering instead. This dramatically impacts system performance and makes results potentially unreliable.

The authors introduce emerald, a gem5-compatible GPU simulator and they use emerald to characterize several GPU workloads.
