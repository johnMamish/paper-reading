## Organization
I need to think a bit about how to organize this.

My current thought is to have high-level folders roughly sorted by discipline. Inside those folders, I can have conferences, and then inside of those folders I can organize by year.

Because of Obsidian's backlinking and organization features, I can tag things. Some ideas of tags:
 - About paper "quality"
	 - "Best of"
	 - "important/foundational in its field"
	 - "best paper award"
	 - "test of time award"
	 - "well-written"
	 - "good figures"
 - About paper topic, e.g.
	 - "intermittent computing"
	 - "energy harvesting"
	 - "circuit design"
	 - "security"
	 - "prefetching"
 - Tag with author's name
 
This means that I'd be able to look at all of the "foundational" papers about "intermittent computing"
