Sensing the presence and remaining content of food containers in a refrigerator can make consumer lives easier and reduce food waste, however, doing this with an RGB camera is hampered by occlusion of user limbs, other food items, and opacity of containers. The authors present an approach using both an infrared and an RGB camera to improve image segmentation and estimate remaining quantity in an opaque container. A key technique developed is how remaining food quantity in an opaque container can be estimated with an IR camera (Figure 1).

personal interest: 6/10
Smart fridge. I know. Barf.
However, the authors make 2 compelling arguments about their work: 1. this can affect consumer behavior in a way that makes consumers more conscious of how wasteful they are; 2. their technique can be generalized to other systems where opaque containers hold liquids.

paper quality / novelty: 6/10
Not a piercingly novel paper, but it takes advantage of a neat observation: the part of the juice carton where there is still juice left will feel colder.
