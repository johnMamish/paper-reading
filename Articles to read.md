- Radial Basis Function Network Control With Improved Particle Swarm Optimization for Induction Generator System
  The exact method isn't of interest so much as the context that this paper will provide
- A reinforcement learning approach for MPPT control method of photovoltaic sources
- An Adaptive Network-Based Reinforcement Learning Method for MPPT Control of PMSG Wind Energy Conversion Systems
  Follow up to the other WECS paper you read. Seems to delve deeper and give a more complete treatment.
- An Overview of Artificial Intelligence Applications for Power Electronics
  Long, probably good for citation hunting.
